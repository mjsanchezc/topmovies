# TopMovies App

TopMovies is an iOS application developed in Swift using SwiftUI. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) design pattern and interacts with The Movie Database (TMDb) API to list, search, and filter movies.


## Features

- **List Movies:** Browse a list of popular movies fetched from TMDb.
- **Search Movies:** Search for movies by title.
- **Filter Movies:** Apply filters to narrow down the list of movies based on various criteria (e.g., genre, release date).


## Technologies Used

- **Swift:** The primary programming language used for iOS development.
- **SwiftUI:** The declarative framework for building user interfaces on iOS.
- **MVVM Design Pattern:** A design pattern that separates the data (Model), UI (View), and business logic (ViewModel) of the application.
- **The Movie Database (TMDb) API:** The API used to fetch movie data.
